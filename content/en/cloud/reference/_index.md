## REST API Reference


### Authenticating with the API

In order to authenticate to Layer5 Cloud's REST API, you need to generate and use a [security token](../security/tokens). Visit your [user account's security tokens](https://meshery.layer5.io/security/tokens) and generate a long-lived security token. Security tokens are without expiration date. You can generate as many tokens as you like. You can also revoke them at any time.

To authenticate with the API, pass the token as a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. For example, in cURL:

```bash

curl <protocol>://<Layer5-cloud-hostname>/<API> \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

```

{{< alert title="Note" >}}

Replace `<protocol>` with `http` or `https` depending on your Layer5 Cloud instance.

Replace `<Layer5-cloud-hostname>` with the hostname or IP address of your hosted Layer5 Cloud instance. For example, [`https://cloud.layer5.io`](https://cloud.layer5.io).

Replace `<API>` with the API endpoint you want to access. For example, `/api/identity/users/profile`.

Replace `<token>` with the security token you generated.

On big screens, paragraphs and headings should not take up the full container width, but we want tables, code blocks and similar to take the full width.

There's a horizontal rule above and below this.

Here is an unordered list:

* Liverpool F.C.

Definition lists can be used with Markdown syntax. Definition headers are bold.

----------------

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 | Epic Records | Grammy Award for Album of the Year, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Brit Award for Best Selling Album, Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical | Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Baby Be Mine, The Girl Is Mine, Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing), The Lady in My Life |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 | Warner Brothers Records | Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Brit Award for Best Soundtrack/Cast Recording, Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal | Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With U, The Beautiful Ones, Computer Blue, Darling Nikki, When Doves Cry, I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm a Star, Purple Rain |

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
foo := "bar";
bar := "foo";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```go
func main() {
  input := `var foo = "bar";`

  lexer := lexers.Get("javascript")
  iterator, _ := lexer.Tokenise(nil, input)
  style := styles.Get("github")
  formatter := html.New(html.WithLineNumbers())

  var buff bytes.Buffer
  formatter.Format(&buff, style, iterator)

  fmt.Println(buff.String())
}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"{`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.
